		/*Methods: a block of code or set of instructions that are executed when we call a method.
		 * 2 types of methods, predefined(Built-in) and user defined
		 * predefined methods are the methods created by java guys, they are part of JDK(Java Development Kit)
		 * like nextInt method
		 * user defined methods are the methods that are created by us.
		 * 
		 * int addTwoNuber(int num1,int num2){
		 * return num1+num2;
		 * }
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * steps to define a method:
		 * 1) return type:
		 * for example in above case int is a return type that means this method does not return any data it can
		 * just execute some logic or can print something on the console. other examples of written type are int,
		 * String, double, etc. Basically we can return all datatypes from a method even the objects and arrays.
		 * 2) method name:
		 * addTwoNumber is the method name in above example
		 * 3) Method Header:
		 * void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is  called method header
		 * 4) addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is called method signature
		 * 5)(int num1,int num2) is called a parameter list the inputs to the method
		 * all the datatypes that we can return from a method we can also take that as input in the form of 
		 * parameters 
		 * 6){
		 * return num1+mum2;
		 * }
		 * is called the method body that contains the logic that is executed when we call a method 
		 * 7) Syntax to call a method
		 * methods obj=new methods();
		 * obj.addTwoNumber(10,12)
		 * 8) return is the keyword that we use to return the data from a method in above example we are not returning 
		 * anything
